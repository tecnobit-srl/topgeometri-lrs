## Upgrade

### From TRAX LRS 2.0.x

In order to upgrade TRAX LRS from version 2.0.x, you need to install the last release of TRAX LRS
with a copy the `.env` file from your previous installation.
The database is not affected by minor upgrades.

### From previous versions

Upgrading from versions older than 2.0.0 is not directly supported.
However, you can install TRAX LRS 2.0.x Extended Edition as a new LRS
and then migrate your xAPI statements with the
[LRS connector](https://extended.traxlrs.com/docs/2.0/lrs).


## Fresh install

### First Steps

Assuming that you want to install TRAX LRS in a folder named **traxlrs**:

```
git clone https://github.com/trax-project/trax2-starter-lrs traxlrs
cd traxlrs
composer install
```

### File Permissions

The folders `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` must be writable both by the webserver and the console user.
Assuming that the ownership has been properly set, you should be able to assign a `0775` permission
to the folders and subfolders and a `644` permission to the files.
Check this post for further details: https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/proper-folder-permissions

If you are not sure how to configure this, you can use the following commands **FOR TESTING PURPOSE ONLY**.

```
chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 777 storage
```

### Web Server

For security reasons, only the `public` folder should be accessible by the web server.
Create a virtual host and configure the document root to `traxlrs/public`.


### Database

Create an empty database with the `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` encoding.
Then, at the root of the application folder, make a copy of the `.env.example` file,
rename it `.env` and enter your database settings.

*MySQL/MariaDB example:*

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=traxlrs
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

*PostgreSQL example:*

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=traxlrs
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=aaaaaa
```

### App URL

In the `.env` file, you must set the public URL of your TRAX LRS application :

```ini
APP_URL=http://traxlrs.test
```

### Last Steps

```
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```


## Admin Account

You can now create an admin account with the following command.
This will give your credentials to log into the application.

```
php artisan admin:create
```

Additional commands are available to manage the admin accounts:

```powershell
php artisan admin:list
php artisan admin:update
php artisan admin:delete
```


## Production server

In the `.env` file, changes settings from:

```ini
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
```

To:

```ini
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
```

To optimize performances, you can run the following commands.

```powershell
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
```

The `php artisan config:cache` command must be ran again after each config change.
